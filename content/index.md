## What is Docker?

Docker is a software management tool which will revolutionise your web projects. You will quickly discover its benefits including:


### Install project dependencies in minutes

Docker can install, configure, manage, and remove any software your project requires. That could include web servers, language runtimes, frameworks, databases, and more.


### Dependencies are lightweight & isolated

Other than disk space, Docker-controlled applications do not change your PC. Multiple or legacy versions of the same software can be run at the same time without conflicts, e.g. MySQL 5 and 8. Dependencies can be started, stopped, removed, or reinstalled at any time.


### Your applications become portable

Your project and its dependencies can be distributed to other development machines and production servers. It will work identically, even on different Operating Systems where that software is not natively supported.

Docker ends those *"but it works on my PC"* complications!


### Use your existing tools & workflows

You and other developers can continue to use whatever software you prefer. It does not matter whether you're using Windows, macOS, Linux, specific IDEs, or other tools. Docker provides all the benefits of local development and debugging.


### Deployments become faster & more robust

Docker can scale your application according to demand and keep it running if instances fail.

Despite these benefits, *Docker is often shunned by web developers*.

> Docker is the most useful web development tool you're not using

It's considered too technical, unnecessary, or something for DevOps experts. Terminology and resources can be impenetrable and tutorials rarely explain how to use Docker during development.

*Until now&hellip;*

***"Docker for Web Developers"*** is a book and video course which shows you how to build fast development environments using jargon-free practical examples. The course is [aimed at web developers]({{ '/course/requirements/' | url }}) with no previous knowledge of Docker.

You'll be launching Docker within minutes and can progress at your own pace.
