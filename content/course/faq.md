The following frequently-asked questions should answer most queries, but please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> to find out more.

<dl>

<dt>Do I need to know specific languages or technologies?</dt>

<dd><em>No!</em> The course provides example projects which refer to JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB etc. but you don't need to understand the code or have experience with those technologies. All Docker concepts apply to whatever stack you're using.</dd>

<dt>How do I watch the videos?</dt>

<dd>You stream them online in your web browser. They're viewable on desktop or mobile devices and available from anywhere.</dd>

<dt>Can I download the videos?</dt>

<dd>If you're buying copies for lots of people in your organisation, <a href="#contact">contact me</a> and I'll provide downloads.</dd>

<dt>Will the course be updated if Docker changes?</dt>

<dd>Yes &ndash; for at least two years after launch. You'll be alerted about the update and can download resources again.</dd>

<dt>How much does it cost?</dt>

<dd><a href="{{ '/' | url }}">$99 US dollars for the full book and video course</a>, plus your country's sales tax where applicable.</dd>

<dt>Can I purchase the books or videos separately?</dt>

<dd>Yes, but I recommend buying both. The book contains more information, but some concepts may be easier to follow on video.</dd>

<dt>Is that a one-off charge?</dt>

<dd>Yes, that's it. Pay once and you have the course forever.</dd>

<dd>Yes. Enter your business ID on the payment form or click the receipt link in your purchase email.</dd>

<dt>Is the course available in my country?</dt>

<dd>Probably. You can buy in more than 160 countries, but <a href="#contact">contact me directly</a> if you have any problems in your location.</dd>

<dt>Can I sell or share the course with others?</dt>
