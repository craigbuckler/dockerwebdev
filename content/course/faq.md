The following frequently-asked questions should answer most queries, but please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> to find out more.

<dl>

<dt>Do I need to know specific languages or technologies?</dt>

<dd><em>No!</em> The course provides example projects which refer to JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB etc. but you don't need to understand the code or have experience with those technologies. All Docker concepts apply to whatever stack you're using.</dd>

<dt>How do I read the book?</dt>

<dd>
<p>The book is supplied in three formats:</p>
