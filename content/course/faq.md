The following frequently-asked questions should answer most queries, but please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> to find out more.

<details>
<summary>Why should I learn Docker?</summary>
<p>Docker makes application development easier and more robust. You'll save time and never need to worry about installing software or managing conflicts again.</p>

<p>It'll also give you a valuable technical skill. Your market value will be considerably increased!</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do other developers use Docker?</summary>
<p><em>They should</em>. I don't say that lightly: Docker is the only tool I'd consider for every project.</p>

<p>However, <a href="{{ '/course/tutor/' | url }}">Docker is often avoided</a> because it's relatively new and seems to have a steep learning curve. Like Git, Docker has many options but you'll rarely use the majority. This course concentrates on the most practical concepts.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to be a web developer?</summary>

<p>The course uses web projects to explain Docker but the concepts apply to other development technologies.</p>

<p>It may also be useful to those in related IT roles, such as software testers, quality assurance, systems administrators, and operations managers.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to know specific languages or technologies?</summary>

<p><em>No!</em></p>

<p>The course provides example projects which refer to JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB etc. but you don't need to understand the code or have experience with those technologies. All Docker concepts apply to whatever stack you're using.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I read the book?</summary>

<p>The book is supplied in three formats:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PDF</strong> can be opened on most devices. Alternative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PDF_software">PDF software options</a> are available.</li>
