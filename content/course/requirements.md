*"Docker for Web Developers"* illustrates the benefits of Docker for web development by quickly creating robust development environments. Within minutes, you'll have the dependencies you need while retaining all the benefits of local development.

The course is desiged for web developers at all levels of experience. You need no previous knowledge of Docker, but an understanding of how web technologies mesh together will be useful:

* web browsers and client-side code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
* web servers and language runtimes (e.g. Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, .NET, etc.)
* other dependencies, such as databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB, etc.)

> If you've ever built a web page or launched a site, you know enough to get started with Docker.

You'll be using a code editor and the command line but any software on any supported Windows 10, mac OS, or Linux device should be suitable.


## Do I need to know specific languages or technologies?

*No!*

The course provides example projects which refer to JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB etc. but you don't need to understand the code or have experience with those technologies. All Docker concepts apply to whatever development technologies you're using.

Docker makes it easy to try software without affecting your development PC. You may have no interest in PHP, but you can run PHP code without knowing the language.

> you don't need to know any particular technology &ndash; all Docker examples can be adapted to your own stack

Experimentation becomes risk-free with Docker. Perhaps you're considering a new database or want to try a beta release of WordPress. That software and all its dependencies can be installed, run, and removed in minutes.
