The course will help you save development time by demonstrating how to use Docker in your own web projects regardless of the technology stack you use. Within a few hours you will discover:

1. What Docker is and how it benefits web development.
1. Docker concepts, terminology, and best practice techniques.
1. How to install Docker and Docker Compose on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
1. How to use, modify, and remove Docker images, containers, volumes, networks in development and production environments.
1. How to make local code updates, use live reloading, and debug a Dockerized application in an editor and browser DevTools.
1. How to push application images to Docker Hub.
1. How to deploy to a Dockerized application to production servers using Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.
1. The most useful Docker, Docker Compose, and Dockerfile commands.

Docker is demonstrated using code you can use or adapt for your own projects. For example:

* launch a database such as [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) in minutes and connect to it using a Dockerized client application such as [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/).
* set-up an isolated [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) theme/plugin development environment using Docker.
* create a customisable [Apache and PHP]({{ '/tutorials/docker-php-development/' | url }}) development environment.
* build a simple containerized *"Hello World"* application with Docker.
* set-up, code, and debug a complex multi-dependency application using Docker to run NGINX, Node.js, MongoDB, and client-side build tools.
