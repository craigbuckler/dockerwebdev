## Why did I create a Docker course?

When I first encountered Docker, it seemed like an unnecessary and somewhat daunting hurdle. I had plenty of experience running VMs and configuring software dependencies &ndash; *surely I didn't need it?*

> The documentation is comprehensive but Docker has a steep learning curve.

Other Docker courses and tutorials can be frustrating. They:

1. pad content and take ages to get to the point

1. presume the reader fully understands all Docker jargon

1. fail to explain or over-explain esoteric points, and

1. rarely advise how to use Docker during development.

   When I started, I presumed Docker couldn't handle dynamic application restarts or debugging. Tutorials often claimed every code change required a slow and cumbersome application rebuild.

*I gave up.*

I was eventually shown the light by another developer *(thanks Glynne!)* I dived deep into Docker and I realised what I'd been missing.

> This is the course I wanted when I started using Docker

The course concisely explains the benefits of Docker then jumps straight in with real-world examples and development projects using a variety of technologies. You'll be running Docker in minutes and will quickly learn the core concepts.
